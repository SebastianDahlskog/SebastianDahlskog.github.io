My third group project at The Game Assembly was a platformer called "Desolate Soul"

It was made in 12 weeks using the school's own engine, TGE.

##  Particle System
I was responsible for the particle system in this game. The editor, made with IMGUI, allowed artists to tune rate of emission, size, speed, falloff, add additional forces such as wind and more.
