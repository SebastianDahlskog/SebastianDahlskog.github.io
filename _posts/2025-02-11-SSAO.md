During my 7th Game Project at The Game Assembly, 
I Implemented SSAO in my group's custom C++ game engine, using DirectX11, with the goal of
improving the graphical fidelity of our game.

## What is SSAO?

SSAO is short for Screen Space Ambient Occlusion.  
In broad terms, SSAO approximates the occlusion of ambient light for a pixel based on its surrounding geometry.

## How Does it Work?

The algorithm samples depth at random positions in a normal-aligned hemisphere around the pixel's position in view-space, and compares 
that depth at those sampled points to the depth at the pixel. More samples that are closer to the camera means more occlusion of the original pixel.
It writes the occlusion to a texture that is then read by the lighting shader where it is factored into the ambient light calculation.

### Beware the noise

The raw output of the SSAO is noticeably noisy, so blurring is needed to smooth out the final picture.
I therefore ran the image through two passes of gaussian blur (horizontal, vertical) to get a smoother result. 
Gaussian blur is not the optimal method for this, it would be better to use something that preserves sharp edges.

## What would I do differently next time?

### Resolution

I would render the SSAO at a smaller resolution than the final image. 
This is perhaps the most obvious optimization, and would be easy to do.

### Blur that respects edges

As I mentioned before, the blur method I used does not preserve sharp edges, which is unfortunate.
I would change the filter to something like kuwahara or median, both of which *do* preserve edges.

### More efficient sampling

This is a basic version of SSAO. It needs a large amount of samples to produce a decent result, 
which isn't good, since sampling textures is very expensive.
There *are* ways to get a good result using fewer samples.
