Hi! My name is Sebastian. I'm a 25-year-old game programmer in my 2nd year at The Game Assembly Stockholm. I’m easygoing and enjoy working in teams where coworkers feel more like friends. While I take my work seriously, I try not to take *myself* too seriously.

My main interest is of course gaming. I love all kinds of games, especially ones where you play with or against other people.

Outside of coding and gaming I enjoy spending time with friends, in person or online, as well as getting out into nature (often for a bike ride).

I'm excited to work with you!
