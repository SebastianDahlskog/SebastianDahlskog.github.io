During the Applied Graphics Programming course at The Game Assembly, 
I had the chance to build my own renderer from scratch
using C++ and DX11. It is a deferred rendering system that has a few neat features.

## Features

* PBR Shading
* Directional, Ambient, Point and Spotlights
* Shadow Mapping for Directional light
* SSAO
* Clustered Shading for Pointlights and Spotlights 
* Instanced rendering
* Deferred with GBuffer
* Skybox
* Mesh VFX
* Particles System
* Postprocessing
* Double Buffered
