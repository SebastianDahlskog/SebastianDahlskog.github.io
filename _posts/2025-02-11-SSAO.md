During my 7th Game Project at The Game Assembly, I Implemented SSAO in my group's custom C++ game engine.

## What is SSAO?

SSAO is short for Screen Space Ambient Occlusion.  
In broad terms, SSAO approximates the occlusion of ambient light for a pixel based on its surrounding geometry.

## How?

The algorithm samples depth at random positions in a normal-aligned hemisphere around the pixel's position in view-space, and compares 
that depth at those sampled points to the depth at the pixel. More samples that have a lower depth (closer to the camera) means more occlusion.
It writes the occlusion to a texture that is then read by the lighting shader where it is factored into the ambient light calculation.

### Beware the noise

The raw output of the SSAO is noticeably noisy, so blurring is needed to smooth out the final picture.
I therefore ran the image through two passes of gaussian blur (horizontal, vertical) to get a smoother result. 
Gaussian blur is not the optimal method for this, it would be better to use something that preserves sharp edges.

## What would I change?

This is a basic version of SSAO. It needs a large amount of samples to produce a decent result, 
which isn't good, since sampling textures is very expensive.
There *are* ways to get a good result using fewer samples, but I am quite happy with how it looks.
