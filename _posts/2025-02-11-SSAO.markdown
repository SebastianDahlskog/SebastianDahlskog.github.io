During my 7th Game Project at The Game Assembly, I Implemented SSAO in my group's custom C++ game engine.

## What is SSAO?

SSAO is short for Screen space ambient occlusion.  
In broad terms, it approximates the occlusion of ambient light for a pixel.

## How?

In broad terms, the algorithm works by sampling points around the pixel's position in view-space, and comparing 
the depth values at those points to the pixel's depth. More samples that have a lower depth means more occlusion.
It writes the occlusion to a texture that is then read by the lighting shader where it is factored into the ambient light calculation.
