My fourth group project at The Game Assembly was a top-down adventure, inspired by enter the gungeon.

Areas of responsibility in this game: 
* Shadow mapping


##  Particle System
I was responsible for the particle system in this game. The editor, made with IMGUI, allowed artists to tune rate of emission, size, speed, falloff, add additional forces such as wind and more.
