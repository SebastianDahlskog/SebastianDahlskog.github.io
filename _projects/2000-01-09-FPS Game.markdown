Our 7th group project at The Game Assembly is called "AI Quit"
and is a fast-paced FPS inspired by [Anger Foot](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978590/Anger_Foot/).

AI Quit was made in our group's own C++ and DX11 engine, Tonic Engine.
It is still in development.

Areas of responsibility in this game: 
* PBR Lighting
* Instanced rendering (boosted our FPS 6x)
* SSAO
* General Programming/Debugging
